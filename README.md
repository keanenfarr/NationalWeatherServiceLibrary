# NationalWeatherServiceLibrary
This is a .Net Core 2.2 library that will query the National Weather Service (NOAA) API and will retrieve current weather conditions and/or weather forecast data for a given latitude and longitude in the United States.

This is meant to be consumed by another .Net app or ASP.NET application as it is only a library.
