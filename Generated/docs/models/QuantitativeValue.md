# NationalWeatherService.Client.Model.QuantitativeValue
A structured value representing a measurement and its unit of measure. This object is a slightly modified version of the schema.org definition at https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Value** | **decimal** | A measured value | [optional] 
**MaxValue** | **decimal** | The maximum value of a range of measured values | [optional] 
**MinValue** | **decimal** | The minimum value of a range of measured values | [optional] 
**UnitCode** | **string** | A string denoting a unit of measure, expressed in the format \&quot;{unit}\&quot; or \&quot;{namespace}:{unit}\&quot;. Units with the namespace \&quot;wmo\&quot; or \&quot;wmoUnit\&quot; are defined in the World Meteorological Organization Codes Registry at http://codes.wmo.int/common/unit and should be canonically resolvable to http://codes.wmo.int/common/unit/{unit}. Units with the namespace \&quot;nwsUnit\&quot; are currently custom and do not align to any standard. Units with no namespace or the namespace \&quot;uc\&quot; are compliant with the Unified Code for Units of Measure syntax defined at https://unitsofmeasure.org/. This also aligns with recent versions of the Geographic Markup Language (GML) standard, the IWXXM standard, and OGC Observations and Measurements v2.0 (ISO/DIS 19156). Namespaced units are considered deprecated. We will be aligning API to use the same standards as GML/IWXXM in the future.  | [optional] 
**QualityControl** | **string** | For values in observation records, the quality control flag from the MADIS system. The definitions of these flags can be found at https://madis.ncep.noaa.gov/madis_sfc_qc_notes.shtml  | [optional]
